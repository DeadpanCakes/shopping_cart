# Digital Storefront

This is a mockup of an ecommerce front end for a business selling houseplants.
This application is only a front end website, and all backend data and functionality is
approximated; all of the item data is generated via factory functions upon load, and
persistence of user and order creations are stored in the browser's localstorage.

This website was built primarily with React, and was my first major project employing
the library. As a result, there are some engineering decisions (such as code duplication
and the misuse of more advanced tools) that I've since improved upon in future projects.
The site design, as well, isn't quite up to my standards nowadays.

Despite all this, I am still proud of this project, as it embodies months of work and
persistence, and the culmination of many other projects I'd worked on prior.
