      <h1>Shipping</h1>
      <p>
        Orders typically take about two to seven days to arrive at your
        doorstep. This period of time is split between two phases:
      </p>
      <h2>Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Voluptatem officia aut delectus aut totam. Velit similique dolores.
        Earum voluptatem inventore ex non.
      </p>
      <h2>Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        Ut quasi commodi illum laboriosam fugiat eum dolorem ut omnis. Non
        necessitatibus sunt doloremque pariatur minima qui possimus voluptas.
        Omnis enim dicta ut. Nesciunt officia aut veritatis.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        Note that we only ship Monday through Wednesday to avoid plants being
        stuck in their boxes over the weekend. This also applies to national
        holidays, when the postal office also takes a break. If you prefer not
        to wait long for your order, placing your order on Monday almost ensures
        that your order will arrive before the week ends.
      </p>
      <h2>Wholesale</h2>
      <p>
        You may have noticed that we limit orders of individual items to 20 or
        fewer. Any order that exceeds this limit should be handled wholesale. We
        do not require any extra paperwork for wholesalers, but the process will
        involve some back and forth to ensure all parties are satisfied. Do not
        hesitate to reach out if you feel that your order is sufficient to
        justify wholesaling-- we are very flexible.
      </p>
      <h2>Customers Outside North America</h2>
      <p>
        At this time, we are not taking orders of live plants from outside the
        contiguous United States and Canada. We hope to eventually expand our
        operations in the future. You may order nonliving products, such as our
        Custom Gritty Potting Mix or tillandsia displays, but understand that we
        make no guarentees about the timeliness of the shipping.
